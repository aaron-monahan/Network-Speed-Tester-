# Network-Speed-Tester-
This project is a java program that tests network speeds. The application will test specific devices and will track the data transfer rate in k/M/G byte tests. 
The application will be coded in the java library jpcap which traces network packets and the interface will be implemented using the built in jframe GUI builder.
